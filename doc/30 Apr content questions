Need:

= hierarchy of topics,( subtopics,) fields
= Vermont has 3 levels of nesting: is 2 acceptable?
= THREE: Topic, Subtopic, Subsubtopic

= list of priority visualizations: BY END OF FRIDAY
= report content: END OF NEXT WEEK
= migrate in: WEEK AFTER

= do narratives : ALL HIERARCHY LEVELS
= are there duplicate fields across tables? : YES

= do visualizations go under subtopics, with a single subtopic?: INTO ANY LEVEL, AT BOTTOM
  = can they go just at the end or might we need to intersperse: NO INTERSPERSE

= would like to use a report as a template
  = should we use Lexington? MAYBE
  = need agreement on the structure not changing significantly CONDITIONAL ON COMMUNITY TYPE


= equity focus in narrative
= is there only one narrative template, filled in with fields & helpers?
    helper example: increasing(field) => "increasing" : "decreasing"


Build agreement on:
  = topic, subtopic, field structure for profile
  = topic, subtopic        structure for simplehpp
  = date for priority viz deadline
  = date for content deadline
  = single narrative template: VIZ AT END



Store the following as a subtopic narrative:

  %h3 Key Findings

  Lexingtonâ€™s population is projected to increase by
  = muni.pop_increase
  residents
  = signed_pct_helper(muni.pop_increase)
  between 2010 and 2030.
  The largest increase will be in people
  = max_age_bracket(muni)
